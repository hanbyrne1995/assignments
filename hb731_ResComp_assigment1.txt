1. How many earthquakes are listed in the table?tail -n +2 signif.txt.tsv | wc -lAnswer: 5958
2. How many columns are in the table?head -n 1 signif.txt.tsv | grep -o $'\t' | wc -lAnswer: 46 is the answer output from the command line; this means that there are 47 columns in total3. Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visually count the column numbers for the above fields (there is also a unix command to do this, but we didn't cover it in class). Call the new data file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv'. You can use 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv' for the rest of the exercises below.Done4. EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.sort -k2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv|head -n 10Answer:2007     1.6    USA2013     2.1    USA2004     2.2    SLOVAKIA2009     3.1    AUSTRALIA2011     3.1    USA1703     3.2    ITALY1999     3.2    RUSSIA2015     3.4    BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA2009     3.4    CHINA2011     3.5    INDIA5. How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.tail -n +2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -d$'\t' -f3 | sort | uniq | wc -lAnswer:1536. Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORYcut -d$'\t' -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep "USA" | wc -lAnswer:2947. Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and you may need to call grep more than once.cut -d$'\t' -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep "USA" | grep -v "TERRITORY" | wc -lAnswer:2558. Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.cut -d$'\t' -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | head -n 10Answer:     56 AFGHANISTAN     53 ALBANIA     55 ALGERIA      4 ANTARCTICA      3 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA     20 ARGENTINA     13 ARMENIA      5 ATLANTIC OCEAN     23 AUSTRALIA      7 AUSTRIA9. Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use the special variable $1. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country USA.#!/bin/bashcountry=$1file=Year_Mag_Country.tsvcut -d$'\t' -f3 $file | sort | uniq -c | grep $1Call: bash countEq.sh "USA"    255 USA     39 USA TERRITORYNote: this doesn’t rule out instances of countries that have the inputted name as part of the full name (e.g., “USA” versus “USA TERRITORIES”)10. Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Use the echo command before each command to create labels for each returned value. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country CHILE.#!/bin/bashcountry=$1file=Year_Mag_Country.tsvearthquakes=$(cut -d$'\t' -f3 $file | sort | uniq -c | grep $1)echo "Number of earthquakes for country:"echo $earthquakeslargestEarthquake=$(grep $country Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort -k2 -g | tail -n 1)echo "Largest earthquake in country:"echo $largestEarthquakeCall: bash countEq_getLargestEq.sh "CHILE"Answer:Number of earthquakes for country:192 CHILELargest earthquake in country:1960 9.5 CHILE11. Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.cut -d$'\t' -f1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | uniq -c | sort -k1 -n | head -n10Answer:      1 10      1 100      1 1007      1 1008      1 1010      1 1013      1 1021      1 1022      1 1026      1 103312.
